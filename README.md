# The-Days-Calendar

The Days Calendar Project is a web application that dynamically displays a monthly calendar with commemorative days that occur annually but not on a fixed date. These special days are retrieved from a JSON file (days.json) and displayed on the correct dates based on their recurrence pattern.
